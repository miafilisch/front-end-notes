# Front End Testing

## Overview
Modern single page application frameworks (react, vue.js, Angular and the like) often come with their own tools and helpers that allow you to thoroughly test these interactions in a pretty low-level (unit test) fashion. Even if you roll your own frontend implementation using vanilla JavaScript you can use your regular testing tools like Jasmine or Mocha.

With a more traditional, server-side rendered application, Selenium-based tests will be your best choice.
