## Intro
> :bulb: AJAX is the process of using JavaScript to send a request to web server, receive a response, and then do something with that data.

AJAX programming relies heavily on the **[XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest) (XHR)** object to communicate with servers. This was first introduced 1999 by Microsoft with IE5.


  
  - It can send and receive information in various formats, including JSON, XML, HTML, and text files.
