# Typescript notes
Typescript is a syntactical superset of ECMAScript developed by Microsoft, which adds optional static typing to the language. It cannot be natively understood by browsers, so needs to be transcompiled to JavaScript before running.

## Typewriter
[Typewriter](https://frhagn.github.io/Typewriter/) is a free extension for Visual Studio that generates TypeScript files from C# code files using TypeScript Templates.

This allows you to create fully typed TypeScript representations of server side API, models, controllers etc. that automatically updates when you make changes to your C# code.

By doing this you get TypeScript Intellisense and compile-time errors when the client- and server side code differs. This speeds up your development pace and increases the quality of your applications.
