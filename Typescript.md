# Typescript notes

## Typewriter
[Typewriter](https://frhagn.github.io/Typewriter/) is a free extension for Visual Studio that generates TypeScript files from C# code files using TypeScript Templates.

This allows you to create fully typed TypeScript representations of server side API, models, controllers etc. that automatically updates when you make changes to your C# code.

By doing this you get TypeScript Intellisense and compile-time errors when the client- and server side code differs. This speeds up your development pace and increases the quality of your applications.
