## Overview
Angular is a **client side application framework** built entirely with static files. This means that the entire application is loaded into the browser that the user is using. There are many performance and user experience benefits to client side frameworks, as follow-up requests to the server will only be for small amounts of data, rather than more HTML & CSS files as is the case with traditional web pages.

Some other client side frameworks include:
- Ember.js
- Backbone.js

The architecture of Angular(JS) is based on model-view-controller (MVC) design. Angular(JS) lends itself particularly well to building **Single Page Applications (SPAs)**, but can also be used to build 'traditional' multi-page applications.

Google developed AngularJS in 2009 and version 1.0 was released in 2012. Angular has since dominated the world of open-source JavaScript frameworks, with enthusiastic support and widespread adoption among both enterprises and individuals. As a result, Angular has evolved from the AngularJS version 1.0 to Angular version 2.0 and now the latest Angular version 4.0, all in just five years.


### AJAX & Angular
- AJAX is a technology that allows to get data from a server without the need to refresh a webpage.

- Angular extends this idea. Even though the entire application is loaded into the browser when user requests a URL, in most cases the application will make additional requests for data back to the server via an AJAX call.

- These requests will not re-send the files to the client, but just the pure data - most of the time the response will be in JSON.

- The Angular app can also send data back to the server.


### Angular vs AngularJS
**AngularJS** is an open-source, JavaScript-based framework for dynamic web app development. It utilizes HTML as a template language. By extending HTML attributes with directives and binding data to HTML with expressions, AngularJS creates an environment that is readable, extraordinarily expressive and quick to develop. 

**Angular** is the blanket term used to refer to Angular 2, Angular 4 and all other versions that come after AngularJS. Both Angular 2 and 4 are open-source, TypeScript-based front-end web application platforms. 

Some key differences include:
- Whilst AngularJS is written in *JavaScript*, Angular uses Microsoftâ€™s *TypeScript* language, which is a superset of ECMAScript 6 (ES6). This has the combined advantages of the TypeScript features, like type declarations, and the benefits of ES6, like iterators and lambdas.

- Unlike Angular, AngularJS was not built with mobile support in mind.

- The later versions, Angular 2 and Angular 4, have been upgraded to provide an overall improvement in performance, especially in page load speed and dependency injection.
