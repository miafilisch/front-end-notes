## Overview
### AJAX vs Angular
AJAX is a technology that allows to get data from a server without the need to refresh a webpage.

Angular extends this idea with two-way data binding. So the HTML elements on your front end page are in constant communication with your back end server--and vice versa. Angular can achieve other things as well and is useful for separating your concerns, i.e. separating your data, the functions performed on that data, and how the user sees the data.

*Something about AngularJS vs Single Page Application (SPA) - lends itself to it well but you can build 'traditional' multi-page applications in Angular(JS) too!
