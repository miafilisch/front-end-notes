# Bundlers, Package Managers and Build Tools

## Overview
(To do)

## Webpack

Webpack's main features are **bundling** and **modularisation**

- rather than linking loads of .js files in template, you only need to add the bundle(s), e.g.: `<script src="./dist/bundle.js""></script>` - reducing web calls and speeding up loading times.


..also link to ES modules as one way of handling modularisation
