## CSS notes
- A **CSS rule** is comprised of a *selector*, and a *declaration block* containing one or more declarations; each declaration contains a *property* and its chosen value
- A comment is denoted by `/* ....... */`
- **Don't repeat yourself:** If you find that a certain style declaration is repeated in lots of different rules, it might be worth breaking out a different class rule for it.


### Selectors
- A **universal selector** can be used via the `*` character
- **Type** or **element selectors** like `h1` or `p` will target all elements of a given HTML tag - good for defining defaults
- **Id selectors** like `#intro-text` target the specific html element that has that id in its attributes (NB: elements can only have one id, and ids have to be unique)
- **Class selectors** like `.primary-content` target all html elements with that class in their attributes (NB: elements can have multiple classes)
- **Descendant selectors** like `.primary-content p` can be made up of two or more selectors and will target all elements that match that relationship, e.g. all "paragraphs" within any elements marked by the "primary-content" class
- **Pseudo-classes** like `:link` `:visited` or `:hover` target elements dynamically based on user interaction, an elementâ€™s state
- *Multiple selectors*, separated by commas, can be used in a rule, such as `.primary-content, .secondary-content`


### Rule Precedence
- The **cascade** determines which styles are assigned to a HTML element; follows 3 main steps to determine which rule to apply:
  - **Importance:** User agent styles < User styles < Author styles
  - **Specificity:** Styles with more specific selectors will override styles with less specific selectors: universal selector < element selectors < class selectors < id selectors < inline styles
  - **Source order:** If there are two or more conflicting declarations within the same rule or level of specificity, the one appearing latest in the source takes precedence. (If there are multiple style sheets, the one linked in last takes precedance.)

- **Inheritance:** if no specific rules are in place for them, elements will inherit the style values of their parent element.


### Text & Fonts
- Create a **font stack** to make sure we have fallbacks of *websafe fonts* as well as *generic font families* defined in case our desired font doesn't work on a given machine
- When using **`font-family`** with multi-word name, use " "s
- Use **font** property as shorthand to specify weight, size (obligatory), line height and family (obligatory), eg.: `font: normal 1em/1.5 "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;`
- `em`s are relative to parent element's pixel size, but the default of 1 "em" is 16px (which is the value of em at the root value) 
- `rem`s are relative to root element's pixel size, i.e. avoid compounding issues when sizing up or down

Other tips:
- Use `text-decoration: none;` to get rid of underlines on links
- The default `font-weight` of headlines is bold
- Adjust **`line-height`** with unit-less values like 1.5 or 2
- You can also adjust letter spacing, e.g.: `letter-spacing: .065em;`

#### Web fonts
Web fonts are special types of fonts optimized for screen display, and linked to our web pages from an external source. They eliminate the need to depend on the limited number of fonts installed on a user's computer.

Web font formats:
- `.eot` - proprietary Internext Explorer format
- `.woff` - open format developed by Mozilla and compatible with most modern browsers
- `.ttf` - used for Safari, Android & iOS display

Add a web font to your style sheet like this:
```
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Abolition Regular';
  src: url('../fonts/abolition-regular-webfont.eot');
  src: url('../fonts/abolition-regular-webfont.eot?#iefix') format('embedded-opentype'),
       url('../fonts/abolition-regular-webfont.woff') format('woff'),
       url('../fonts/abolition-regular-webfont.ttf') format('truetype');
}
```

### Box Model Elements

![CSS Box Model](https://github.com/minkaotic/front-end-notes/blob/master/box_model.png)

#### Block vs inline display
- Most common values for the `display` property are `block` (creating a new line after element), `inline` (not breaking into a new line), and `inline-block`
- `inline-block` is useful in cases when we want items to appear next to each other, but still want top/bottom margin to be applied as if the whole set was a block element 
- `li { display: inline; }` to keep list items next to each other on one line, then use padding and margin to neaten up visually (for more advanced list manipulation, see: https://teamtreehouse.com/library/lists-5)

#### Borders
- **Border shorthand**: `border: [width] [style] [color]` - or do each of them individually for control over each side, eg.: `border-width: 10px 20px`, or `border-top: 2px solid lightgrey;`. NB:
  - when not specifying a colour, the colour is inherited from the element's text colour.
  - When using **2 value shorthand**, the first value refers to top/bottom and the second to left/right.
  - When using **3 value shorthand**, the values refer in order to: TOP, LEFT/RIGHT, BOTTOM
- *Similar rules apply to settings for margin and padding*

#### Margin, padding and box-sizing
- **`margin: auto`** will generally **centre** content on the page!
- `width` values provided as **percentages** are applied in relation to the *parent container* - and `width` generally applies only to the *content* of the box, i.e. not including its padding and border, however...
- **`box-sizing: border-box`** dynamically subtracts the borders and paddings of the element from the width and height properties we set, making it easier to define flexible widths and heights in our project (it's one of the few good uses for the universal selector!) *
- `max-width` sets the maximum width of an element, preventing elements to become too large to look good on big screens; when set as percentage values can also be used as part of responsive design *

(* for more on `box-sizing` and `max-width` see https://teamtreehouse.com/library/boxsizing-and-maxwidth)


### Colour & Background Images
Colours can be set as either:
- **keyword values**, e.g. `orange`
- **hexadecimal values**, e.g. `#fff or #878787`
- or **rgb functions**, e.g. `rgb(255, 169, 73)`

In addition, **rgba functions** allow setting transparency via alpha value, eg. `rgba(255, 255, 255, .5)`

- Every HTML element has a background layer that is transparent by default, but can be filled using `background-image` or `background-color`
- Specify a background image with `background-image: url('../img/mountains.jpg')`
- By default, `background-image`s are left aligned and repeated (aka tiled)
- Specify the size of the background image as a percentage of the containing element width with `background-size: 60%;`
- `background-size: cover` adjusts the background area so that it's **completely covered by the background image** (if using), while maintaining its width and height proportions
- Best practice: set background colour as well when using background images, to preserve the contrast between the background and content in case the image isn't available
- Handy all-in-one **background shorthand:** `background: #ffa949 url('../img/mountains.jpg') no-repeat center / cover;`


### Media Queries for Responsive Design
Media queries allow us to tailor our content to a wide range of devices and viewport sizes without having to change anything in the HTML. For example, to set up various media query breakpoints for different styles depending on browser size:

```
@media all and (max-width: 960px) {
  [selector] {
    [style declaration]
  }
}

@media all and (max-width: 480px) {
  [selector] {
    [style declaration]
  }
}
```

For more detail see: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media

#### Viewport meta tag

Using **mobile device emulation in Chrome dev tools**, you'll notice that often our CSS rules for responsive design using media queries might not be applied to certain mobile phones, as they may be using virtual viewports rather than the real viewport size. To get around this, we need to use the HTML `viewport` meta tag in the head of any HTML pages:

```
<head>
    <title>...</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">
    <meta name "viewport" content="width=device-width">
</head>
```

### Fancy Design

#### Floats
Floats are one of the most commonly used methods for laying out a page with CSS. When an element is floated, the element is taken out of the normal flow of the page and placed along the left or right side of its container, causing other elements to wrap around it.

- First, change the element's `width` to something less than 50% (just like width, floats are relative to the parent container!)
- **`float: right`** will float something to the right, vice versa for left

**Common issues:** If a block element contains floated children, its height will collapse, causing elements to overlap where they shouldn't... options for resolving this:
- Add `overflow: auto;` for the parent element. Possible downsides: in some browsers, unwanted scroll bars might appear, or bits of content might be cut off
- **Clearfix** is the most reliable way to prevent these issues! - Targeting the parent element of the elements that are floated, it looks like this: 

```
[parent selector]:after {
  content: "";
  display: table;
  clear: both;
}
```
- often, a new `.group` class is used for clearfix, which can be assigned to any parent requiring it
- cf. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clear and http://nicolasgallagher.com/micro-clearfix-hack/

#### Shadow effects
- **Text shadow** takes 4 values: *horizontal offset, vertical offset, blur radius (optional) and colour*, e.g. `text-shadow: 5px 8px 10px #222;`. Multiple sets of values, separated by commas, will build more complex shadow effects.
- **Box shadow** is similar to text shadow but with optional value of *spread* before the colour value, e.g. for a small bottom box-shadow: `box-shadow: 0 20px 10px -12px rgba(0,0,0, .8);`
- Neat **inner** shadow effect: `box-shadow: inset 0 0 50px 10px rgba(0,0,0, 1);`

#### Rounded corners
- use `border-radius` - takes any absolute or relative length value (px, em, % etc.), e.g. `border-radius: 50px 10px;`

#### Gradients
Gradients create smooth and gradual transitions between two or more colours. Some examples:
- Simple gradient with default top-to-bottom angle: `background-image: linear-gradient(#ffa949, firebrick);`
- With specific angle defined: `linear-gradient(to left, #ffa949, firebrick)` or `linear-gradient(45deg, #ffa949, firebrick)`
- Radial gradient with circular centre: `background-image: radial-gradient(circle, #ffa949, firebrick);`
- Radial gradient with 3 colours & moved centre circle: `radial-gradient(circle at top right, #ffa949, firebrick, dodgerblue)`
- As above, plus specificed colour stops: `radial-gradient(circle at top right, #ffa949 0%, firebrick 20%, dodgerblue 100%)`

It is also possible to layer a number of gradients on top of each other, or layer a gradient over a background image:
```
background: linear-gradient(#ffa949, transparent 60%),
            #ffa949 url('../img/mountains.jpg') no-repeat center;
```
