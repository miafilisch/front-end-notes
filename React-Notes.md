# React Notes
[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Simplifies building and maintaining the UI of your application by breaking it up into smaller, reusable *components*.
- Reduces the complexity of updating your DOM elements when users interact with your application, thanks to the *virtual DOM*: when your application's data changes, React figures out which parts of your document need to be changed, and immediately updates only those parts.

## Setup
There are 2 common ways to add React to a new project:
1. Using [React toolchains](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html), for example [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app)
2. with [React's CDN links](https://reactjs.org/docs/cdn-links.html)

#### Why 2 separate libraries?
:bulb: When building web applications in React, you use two libraries: `React` and `ReactDom`:
- React started out as a library for building interfaces in the browser, but the patterns and tools it provided proved so useful that it has since been extended to native application development.
- When React Native came along, `React` (as the core library), and `ReactDom` (for web app development) were split into two libraries.
