# SASS Notes
[Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) is a stylesheet language that extends CSS with features like **variables**, **nested rules**, **mixins** and **functions**, in a CSS-compatible syntax. A stylesheet written in Sass needs to be translated (or compiled) into plain CSS before the browser can read it.

- Split styles into partials to make styles more modular and easier to maintain
